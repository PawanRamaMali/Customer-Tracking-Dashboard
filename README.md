# Customer-Tracking-Dashboard

Customer Tracking Dashboard in R


## Data Explanation

These reports show year over year performance for many customer segments and product groups. Top level performance (i.e. revenue) is decomposed into lower level performance metrics (i.e. customer visits, items purchased, and checkout spend). For example, in week 1 revenue for the all segments and products increased by 22.9 compared to last year. The main contributors to the increase were visits (+12.1%) and spend (+6.3%).
